					<h1 id="top">Citizenship</h1>

					<h3 id="citizenship">Permanent Residency</h3>
					<p>The path to becoming a US citizen begins with a Permanent Residency. Once an
					immigrant has been approved as a Permanent Resident of the US (also known as a
					Green Card holder), they must reside in the US for a time of five years. Foreign
					visits during this timeframe are to be kept under six months per year at a time,
					in order to help the citizenship process go smoothly. One this five year time
					period has ended, immigrants will now be eligible for Naturalization.More information on this process can be found <strong>here</strong></p>
					<h3 id="naturalization">Naturalization</h3>
					<p>Naturalization is not a process, separate to citizenship, but merely a part
					of it. Prior to this, all <a href="#">citizenship requirements</a> must be
					met, including passing a general knowledge test about US History. After all
					requirements have been met, the final step is attending a naturalization
					ceremony. A naturalization ceremony can take place, typically in federal
					courthouses. Many people are are scheduled for a ceremony at a time. During
					the ceremony, prospective citizens must swear an <a href="">Oath of
					Allegiance</a>, to the US and the Constitution, and will henceforth become
					official United States citizens. <p>
					<h3 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h3>
					<p>Among a citizens rights and duties are their obligation to engage in
					community events. This may be in the form of partaking in community gatherings
					or volunteering ones time and energy to local non-profits to ones best ability.
					Many, if not all, of these non-profits have a website for themselves, as a way
					to spread the word about their mission and to recruit volunteers.
					<strong>HERE</strong> is a site where you simply input your location and it will
					search the nearest non-profit or community organization. This way, the efforts
					of all those who help will be fruited in their own local communities.</p>
					<h3 id="congresspeople">Contact Your Congrespeople</h3>
					<p>Congresspeople are people elected by the people, for the people. As such,
					they are responsible for listening to their constituents and to take action on
					their behalf. After all, elected Congresspeople are the voices of the regular
					American citizen. The American people elect these Congresspeople into office so
					that they can fix their problems. Because of this, civic engagement is strongly
					characterized by citizens reaching out to their local representatives in order
					to discuss or take action on issues plaguing society. There a total of 535
					Senators and Representatives in the nation. Contacting them or getting ahold of
					their time is really not as intimidating as it sounds. Any form of contact
					works, including email, mail, or telephone. Pigeon delivery has been
					discontinued. As with everything, patience and persistence is key.</p>
