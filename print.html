					<h1>Know Your Nation</h1>
					<br>
					<h2>The Constitution</h2>
					<p>The Constitution is the document that lays the framework for the American
					government. It dictates who gets what powers and what is legal and all of the
					essentials needed to create and run a nation. It is based on the idea of
					Separation of Powers, meaning a system in which the responsibilities of running
					a nation lie on multiple branches. In the case of the Constitution, three
					branches were created. </p>
					<h3>Branches of Government</h3>
					<p>At the time of its conception, the United States was to be the only
					democratic nation in the world. Democracy itself was a very unusual idea at the
					time, as many societies were under the influence of absolute monarchies. Tired
					of the oppression of the individual under such governments, the founders of the
					United States wanted to create a nation where the duty of government would lay
					in the hands of the citizens. The people. The founding fathers drew from ancient
					governing structures consisting of Greek direct democracy and Roman
					representative democracy. They went on to create a governing body of three
					branches, each with a system of checks and balances on the other so no branch
					would be able to attain absolute power. </p>
					<h3>Legislative Branch</h3>
					<p>The legislative branch is a culmination of the aforementioned ancient
					governing systems: Greek direct democracy and Roman representative democracy.
					Direct democracy embodies the House of Representatives which is a subdivision of
					the Legislative branch. The House of Representatives is an assembly of elected
					representatives from each constituency of each state and territory of the United
					States. Currently there are a maximum of 435 seats for representatives In The
					House. Representative democracy comes in play with the US Senate. The Senate is
					an assembly consisting of two senators from each state, bringing the total from
					50 states to 100. Collectively, the Legislative Branch, also known as Congress.
					Has its own set of responsibilities and duties. First and foremost, Congress is
					responsible for making all the laws in the United States. The process of making
					a law is long and complicated and more information about it can be found can be
					found “here”. Along with lawmaking Congress is also responsible for the annual
					budget taxes on the citizens declaring war on other countries. </p>
					<h3>Executive Branch</h3>
					<p>The executive branch is responsible for enforcing all the laws created by
					Congress. It consists of the president, vice president and cabinet. The
					president is elected by an electoral college on election day and the cabinet
					members are hand selected by the president who need to be approved by Congress
					The cabinet consists of Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce,
					Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of
					Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Housing
					and Urban Development, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Justice,
					Secretary of Labor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary
					of the Treasury Secretary of Veterans Affairs. While this is a very long list the
					main point is that everyone in the executive branch is responsible for
					upholding the laws of the nation and keeping its inhabitants safe and healthy.</p>
					<h3>Judicial Branch</h3>
					<p>The judicial branch is the nation’s justice system. It is a complex
					hierarchy of lower courts and judges. At the top of the chain is the Supreme
					Court, whose say is final in all decisions and cases. At the supreme court,
					there are 9 federal judges who serve life terms and are selected for the job by
					the president with Congressional approval, The judicial branch as a whole is
					responsible for upholding the law and holding all citizens who break them
					accountable. The supreme court is responsible for interpreting the law itself, a
					power which can be very influential in future cases. According to the US
					constitution, every person has the right to a fair trial, and so everybody is
					presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. There are also numerous
					stipulations regarding the judicial branch within the Constitution. </p>
					<h3>Checks and Balances</h3>
					<p>Checks and Balances are a system of keeping all three branches of the
					government in level with each other. Under this system, no branch can get too
					powerful as its powers are dependent on and interlinked with the other two
					branches. For example, the executive branch has the power to make necessary
					executive orders, yet the financing for them depends on the Congress, as it has
					control over the national purse. Another example of Check and balances would be
					how The executive branch appoints Supreme Court Judges, yet they rely on
					Congressional approval once more.</p>


					<h2 id="top">The Bill of Rights</h2>
					<p>The bill of rights is another document that dictates the fundamental rights
					of every citizen of the United States of America. At its conception, the
					founders of America named 10 key amendments. However, this list has been
					expanded to a total of 27 amendments to the Bill of Rights. Below is a list of
					all of the Amendments to the Constitution. However, since the Constitution was
					writen in semi-archaic English, the nformation below is a loose translation of
					the modern interpretaions of the twenty-seven amendments.</p>
					
					<h3 id="amendments">The Amendments</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Guarantees the rights of freedom of speech, the press, and religion. It also protects the people's right to petition the government for change</li>

						<li>Grants citizens eighteen or older the right to vote</li>  
						<li>Laws varying the salaries of Congresspeople will take effect during the next term</li>  

					</ol>



					<h2 id="top">Duties of the Citizen</h2>
					<p>While the framework of the US, being unusual at the time of its creation,
					   explicitly grants many rights to its citizens, it also expects citizens to
					   oblige with a fair share of their individual duties. This system of giving
					   powers to a vested governing body in return for citizens to live their normal
					   lives is a <strong>Social Contract</strong>. Social Contract theory was a
					   radical and revolutionary new way of thinking in the late 18th and 19th
					   centuries. Yet the framers of the American Constitution believed it would be
					   the best way of preserving the people's right to self rule, while not
					   constantly engaging in active governing themselves. Instead they would
					   relinquish their powers to elected individuals to be able to carry happily.
					   However, this does not mean that citizens are completely separated from the
					   government and its happenings. Citizens are encouraged to actively voice
					   their opinions if they see a need for change. This right to voice one's
					   opinions is protected by the first amendment. Along with watching the
					   governing process, citizens are also responsible for a few legal duties as
					   well. These include:
						<ul>
							<li>Defending the Constitution- Defending its ideals and the values that it stands for</li>
							<li>Staying informed of community issues- Being aware of what is happening in one's suroundings</li>
							<li>Participate in local community- actively contributing to the betterment of ones community</li>
							<li>Participate in American Democracy and its process- Exercise the democratic right to vote and select representatives</li>
							<li>Obeying federal and state laws</li>
							<li>Respecting the, rights, opinions, and boundaries of other- Not intentionally offending others through one's thoughts, behaviors, or actions</li>
							<li>Paying taxes punctually and with integrity</li>
							<li>Serving on a Jury- Using this Constitutional right to ensure everyone is given a fair trial by jury</li>
							<li>Serving to defend the nation if needed- Signing up for military service if able to do so</li>
						</ul>
					</p>			
					


					<h2 id="top">Citizenship</h2>

					<h3 id="citizenship">Permanent Residency</h3>
					<p>The path to becoming a US citizen begins with a Permanent Residency. Once an
					immigrant has been approved as a Permanent Resident of the US (also known as a
					Green Card holder), they must reside in the US for a time of five years. Foreign
					visits during this timeframe are to be kept under six months per year at a time,
					in order to help the citizenship process go smoothly. One this five year time
					period has ended, immigrants will now be eligible for Naturalization.</p>
					<h3 id="naturalization">Naturalization</h3>
					<p>Naturalization is not a process, separate to citizenship, but merely a part
					of it. Prior to this, all citizenship requirements must be
					met, including passing a general knowledge test about US History. After all
					requirements have been met, the final step is attending a naturalization
					ceremony. A naturalization ceremony can take place, typically in federal
					courthouses. Many people are are scheduled for a ceremony at a time. During
					the ceremony, prospective citizens must swear an Oath of
					Allegiance, to the US and the Constitution, and will henceforth become
					official United States citizens. <p>
					<h3 id="volunteering">Community Service</h3>
					<p>Among a citizens rights and duties are their obligation to engage in
					community events. This may be in the form of partaking in community gatherings,
					or volunteering to local non-profits, or even joining local grassroots organizations to make changes in ones community.
					Many, if not all, of these non-profits have a website for themselves, as a way
					to spread the word about their mission and to recruit volunteers.
					This way, the efforts of volunteers will be fruited in their own local communities.</p>
					<h3 id="contact">Contact Your Local Congresspeople</h3>
					<p>Congresspeople are people elected by the people, for the people. As such,
					they are responsible for listening to their constituents and to take action on
					their behalf. After all, elected Congresspeople are the voices of the regular
					American citizen. The American people elect these Congresspeople into office so
					that they can fix their problems. Because of this, civic engagement is strongly
					characterized by citizens reaching out to their local representatives in order
					to discuss or take action on issues plaguing society. There a total of 535
					Senators and Representatives in the nation. Contacting them or getting ahold of
					their time is really not as intimidating as it sounds. Any form of contact
					works, including email, mail, or telephone. As with everything, patience and persistence is key.
