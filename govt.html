					<h1 id="top">The Constitution</h1>
					<p>The Constitution is the document that lays the framework for the American
					government. It dictates who gets what powers and what is legal and all of the
					essentials needed to create and run a nation. It is based on the idea of
					Separation of Powers, meaning a system in which the responsibilities of running
					a nation lie on multiple branches. In the case of the Constitution, three
					branches were created. </p>
					<h3 id="branches">Branches of Government</h3>
					<p>At the time of its conception, the United States was to be the only
					democratic nation in the world. Democracy itself was a very unusual idea at the
					time, as many societies were under the influence of absolute monarchies. Tired
					of the oppression of the individual under such governments, the founders of the
					United States wanted to create a nation where the duty of government would lay
					in the hands of the citizens. The people. The founding fathers drew from ancient
					governing structures consisting of Greek direct democracy and Roman
					representative democracy. They went on to create a governing body of three
					branches, each with a system of checks and balances on the other so no branch
					would be able to attain absolute power. </p>
					<h3 id="legislative">Legislative Branch</h3>
					<p>The legislative branch is a culmination of the aforementioned ancient
					governing systems: Greek direct democracy and Roman representative democracy.
					Direct democracy embodies the House of Representatives which is a subdivision of
					the Legislative branch. The House of Representatives is an assembly of elected
					representatives from each constituency of each state and territory of the United
					States. Currently there are a maximum of 435 seats for representatives In The
					House. Representative democracy comes in play with the US Senate. The Senate is
					an assembly consisting of two senators from each state, bringing the total from
					50 states to 100. Collectively, the Legislative Branch, also known as Congress.
					Has its own set of responsibilities and duties. First and foremost, Congress is
					responsible for making all the laws in the United States. The process of making
					a law is long and complicated and more information about it can be found can be
					found “here”. Along with lawmaking Congress is also responsible for the annual
					budget taxes on the citizens declaring war on other countries. </p>
					<h3 id="executive">Executive Branch</h3>
					<p>The executive branch is responsible for enforcing all the laws created by
					Congress. It consists of the president, vice president and cabinet. The
					president is elected by an electoral college on election day and the cabinet
					members are hand selected by the president who need to be approved by Congress
					The cabinet consists of Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce,
					Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of
					Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Housing
					and Urban Development, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Justice,
					Secretary of Labor, Secretary of State, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary
					of the Treasury Secretary of Veterans Affairs. While this is a very long list the
					main point is that everyone in the executive branch is responsible for
					upholding the laws of the nation and keeping its inhabitants safe and healthy.</p>
					<h3 id="judicial">Judicial Branch</h3>
					<p>The judicial branch is the nation’s justice system. It is a complex
					hierarchy of lower courts and judges. At the top of the chain is the Supreme
					Court, whose say is final in all decisions and cases. At the supreme court,
					there are 9 federal judges who serve life terms and are selected for the job by
					the president with Congressional approval, The judicial branch as a whole is
					responsible for upholding the law and holding all citizens who break them
					accountable. The supreme court is responsible for interpreting the law itself, a
					power which can be very influential in future cases. According to the US
					constitution, every person has the right to a fair trial, and so everybody is
					presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. There are also numerous
					stipulations regarding the judicial branch within the Constitution. </p>
					<h3 id="cnb">Checks and Balances</h3>
					<p>Checks and Balances are a system of keeping all three branches of the
					government in level with each other. Under this system, no branch can get too
					powerful as its powers are dependent on and interlinked with the other two
					branches. For example, the executive branch has the power to make necessary
					executive orders, yet the financing for them depends on the Congress, as it has
					control over the national purse. Another example of Check and balances would be
					how The executive branch appoints Supreme Court Judges, yet they rely on
					Congressional approval once more. A full list and explanation to this system can
					be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/checks-and-balances#:~:text=Checks%20and%20Balances%20Examples%201%20The%20president%20%28head,the%20Senate%20confirms%20those%20nominations.%20More%20items...%20">
